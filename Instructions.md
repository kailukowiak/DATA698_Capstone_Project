# Project Proposal

Proposal Approval Process

Submit a short (1-2 page) project proposal, including the following:

- Description of the problem
- Why the problem is interesting
- What other approaches have been tried
- Discussion on your hypothesis is and how your specific solution will improve
  or solve the problem
- I will then review your proposal and provide feedback, ultimately accepting
  it, rejecting it, or conditionally accepting it based on an agreed-upon change
  to the plan/proposal. In particular, I will ensure that the project is
  properly scoped for the expected time commitment, and that the problem is
  sufficiently challenging that it serves as a good demonstration of what you
  have mastered in the program. Note that your approach and solution to the
  problem must also be novel and be sufficiently challenging for you.

The project proposal must be submitted no later than Monday, September 17,
11:59pm EST.
