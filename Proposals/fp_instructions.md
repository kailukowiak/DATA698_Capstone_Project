 Submit your Final Project

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

1. Final project papers are required to be medium length 20-24 total pages
(10-12 pages double-sided) and double spaced, along with a runnable demo of any
code.
1. Code listings, interpreter output, and exploratory data visualization should
not be included in the paper itself.
1. In keeping the amount of required pages relatively low, we expect the writing
to be concise, succinct, and to-the-point.
1. Key points should be expressed in clear, simple and easy-to-understand
language.
1. The final project paper, along with supporting commentary -- discussion of
prior approaches, results of the student's approach, and a final assessment of
whether the project effectively solved the goal â€“ must be
submitted 3 weeks before the course ends.  
1. Given that most Capstones are group projects, it is preferred that final
papers are prepared in LaTeX, using the collaborative features of online LaTeX
editors such as overleaf.com or sharelatex.com. Alternately, papers may be
prepared in Microsoft Word format (Microsoft Word 2010) and delivered in Adobe
Acrobat PDF format (Adobe Acrobat
XI Pro).
1. Written papers shall be prepared on standard 8.5 x 11 inch pages.
1. Student name and course code must be included in the heading section for all
pages.
1. The proposal pages shall be bound along the left side and numbered on the
bottom, right side. Each page shall have a one-inch margin at the top and
the bottom and on each side.
1. Notations of proprietary material and any other identifying information
printed on each page may be included in the margin.
1. Text shall be in Times New Roman, 12 point font. However, text included in
figures or graphics in the written proposal may be reduced to 9 point font,
times new roman.
1. Table text must maintain 12 point font.  Should the proposal require foldout
pages for graphics, one foldout page shall not exceed 17 x 11 inches.
1. Foldouts will be counted as two (2) pages, regardless of size, and
subsequent page numbering must be adjusted appropriately.  
1. During the first week of the semester, you will receive an email at your SPS
email address, providing credentials to the ePortfolio platform in
Digication. You will be required to upload your final paper to an ePortfolio
(created by you). All questions related to the use of the platform should be
directed to eportfolios@sps.cuny.edu.

NOTE: STUDENTS WHO DO NOT POST FINAL PROJECT to ePortfolios@sps.cuny.edu will
not receive a final grade and thus not receive credit for completing the course.

Students may also create a website site or use of another multimedia platform if
they wish to highlight specific case studies and examples (e.g., YouTube,
Facebook, etc.).

The final project must be submitted by Monday, December 17, 11:59pm EDT.
